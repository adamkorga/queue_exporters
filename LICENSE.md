# "THE BOOKWARE LICENSE" (Revision 42)

Adam Korga (contact@adamkorga.com) wrote this file. As long as you retain  
this notice you can do whatever you want with this stuff. 

I provide NO WARRANTY. It works on my machine. If it burns down your server  
or emails your ex, that's on you.

## CONTEXT & HISTORY:

Normally, this would be a standard Beerware license  
(see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poul-Henning_Kamp#Beerware).  

However, since I don't drink alcohol and the probability of us meeting IRL  
is statistically insignificant, I decided to refactor the gratitude protocol.

## THE DEAL:

If you find this stuff worth it, you can thank me by buying one of my books  
(I won't be offended if you buy more than one) or at least consider  
subscribing to the newsletter.
